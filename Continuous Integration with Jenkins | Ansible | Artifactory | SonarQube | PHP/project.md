# Configure Ansible configuration repo For Jenkins Deployment

This is project is continuation from my ansible dynamic assignment projects.
I would be using a copy of the  `ansible-config-mgt` repo which I have renamed `ansible-configuration`


## `Installing Jenkins`

Start by launching an AWS EC2 instance with a RedHat OS and set up the Jenkins server.
